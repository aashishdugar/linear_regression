# Linear Regression w/ Gradient Descent
This program shows how step by step Linear Regression happens with a break down of each step in different functions, followed by an implementation of Regular/Batch/Stochastic Gradient Descent. Here we use more than 2 variables, i.e., example of Multivariate Linear Regression.

##### Linear Regression
In simple terms, it's (Supervised Learning) approach for predicting the next value given some data.

* In the case of the program, We first carry out Normalization. This process helps put the values to a certain scale, such that they revolve around a scalable and better understandable value. This is usually from [0,1].

* We then proceed with hypothesis function [theta] to minimize the loss.
